#HOMEWORK 2: PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO

This project was indended to give me an indea of what is needed to build a professional portfolio website from scratch using HTML and CSS.

In the process of building the site, I learned more about which tags are appropriate for certain kinds of content and where they should be placed (semantic HTML).
I also learned about flexboxes and media queries in CSS, a language that I know I'll have to work on for some time to come.

The portfolio is meant to display a number of photos with corresponding text, contact links, and an attractive design that scales to fit the screen of 
any desktop or mobile container.
